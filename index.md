Welcome to the PolyEdge documentation. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running PolyEdge, including occupancy tracking and Docker installation.

## What is PolyEdge?

PolyEdge is NR & WiFi based Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) or Joint Communications and Sensing (JSAC) solutions aimed at 3GPP rel 19 advanced and 6G features specifically for using communication waveforms for the purpose of sensing. PolyEdge is designed to address and bring ISAC capabitities to NR and WiFi today, PolyEdge has NR support for both TDD/FDD duplexing mode with a 2x2 MIMO scheme, scs = 15/30 KHz and max bandwidth = 20/40MHz. For 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax/be PolyEdge supports  bandwidths (20/40 MHz) and up to 2x2 MIMO scheme.
