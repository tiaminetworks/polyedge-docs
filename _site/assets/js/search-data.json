Docker supports 64-bit versions of these distributions: Ubuntu Oracular 24.10 Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (LTS) Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (LTS) Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (LTS) . 2. Add Docker’s Official GPG Key . Run the following commands to add Docker’s official GPG key: . sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc . 3. Add the Docker Repository to Apt Sources . Run the following commands to add the Docker repository: . echo \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \\ https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release &amp;&amp; echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable\" | \\ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &gt; /dev/null sudo apt-get update . 4. Install Docker Engine: Run the following commands to install Docker Engine: . sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin . 5. Install Buildx . 1. Download the latest Buildx release from Docker Buildx Releases. 2. Move the Buildx distribution with the following commands: . mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ mv &lt;downloaded-buildx-file&gt; ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx . 6. Add Your User to the Docker Group: Avoid needing sudo for Docker commands: . sudo usermod -aG docker $USER sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock . 7. Docker CLI and usage: . PolyEdge leverages docker services to expose relevant entrypoints for both WiFi and NR. To service these ports such as for terminal interactivity in docker-cli the service-ports arg is utilized. docker compose run --service-ports polyedge . Where polyedge is the container name servicing PolyEdge, by default this invokes the entrypoint for WiFi. ",
